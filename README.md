First of all, I want to say that this sample is too small for certain conclusions, however, we can use the concept of p-value.
Let's formulate a hypothesis that there is no issue here, reject our hypothesis if p-value is less than 0.05.

In the main class, there is a code that simulates the results of the game, and then compares how much our sample is with the rest of the random ones, the results of our sample are less than 0.01, so we can reject our hypothesis and send the game for additional testing.
